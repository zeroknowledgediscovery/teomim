### Understanding the Prevalence Rates:
- **High (50-70%)**: This means that for every 100 dementia patients, 50 to 70 of them might also have this condition.
- **Moderate to High (20-40%)**: 20 to 40 out of every 100 dementia patients might be affected.
- **Moderate (10-25%)**: This suggests a significant but not overwhelming overlap, with 10 to 25 out of every 100 dementia patients affected.
- **Variable (10-30%)**: The prevalence can vary widely based on different factors and populations.
